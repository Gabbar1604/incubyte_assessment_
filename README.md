Mithai Junction is a full-stack Sweet Shop Management System developed as part of the Incubyte TDD Kata assessment. The project focuses on clean backend design, test-driven development, and basic frontend integration. The backend is built using FastAPI and handles core business logic such as managing sweets, processing purchases, handling out-of-stock cases, and enforcing role-based access using JWT authentication. A simple React frontend is used to display available sweets, show prices and stock quantity, and allow users to purchase items while automatically disabling actions when stock is unavailable. The entire backend is covered with pytest test cases to ensure correctness and reliability. AI tools were used only as development assistance for boilerplate and debugging, while all logic, decisions, and final implementation were fully understood and written manually.
